# ScriptCommunicator
ScriptCommunicator is a scriptable cross-platform data terminal that supports serial port (RS232, USB to serial), UDP, TCP client/server, SPI, I2C, and CAN.
All sent and received data can be shown in a console and can be logged in an html and a text log.

In addition to the simple sending and receiving of data, ScriptCommunicator has a JavaScript interface.
This script interface has the following features:
* Scripts can send and receive data with the main interface.
* In addition to the main interface scripts can create and use their own interfaces (serial port (RS232, USB to serial), UDP, TCP client, TCP server, PCAN, and SPI/I2C).
* Scripts can use their own GUI (GUI files which have been created with QtDesigner (is included) or QtCreator). 
* Multiple plot windows can be created by scripts (QCustomPlot  developed by Emanuel Eichhammer is used)
